The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

.container div {
  width: 50%;
}

.container .item {
  width: 25%;
}

.container div.item {
  width: 20%; /* This rule should override the previous two */
}
```

The issue is that despite the `.container div.item` selector being more specific than the `.container div` and `.container .item` selectors, it is possible, depending on the browser and how the HTML is structured, that the browser might not apply the `width: 20%;` rule as expected. This could occur when the HTML structure is like this:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item"></div>
</div>
```

In this case, the `.container div.item` selector's specificity might not always be higher than `.container div` or `.container .item`. This is due to how the browser resolves the specificity of the selectors. This could lead to unpredictable results in the rendered width.
